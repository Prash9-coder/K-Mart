## Database Maintenance

### MongoDB Atlas

1. **Regular Backups**
   - MongoDB Atlas provides automated backups
   - Configure backup schedule in Atlas dashboard
   - Test restore process periodically

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Use MongoDB Atlas monitoring tools
   - Check for slow queries
   - Optimize indexes as needed

3. **Scaling**
   - Monitor database size and connection count
   - Upgrade cluster tier if approaching limits
   - Consider sharding for very large datasets

## Application Updates

### Backend Updates

1. **Prepare Update**
   - Create a feature branch for changes
   - Test changes thoroughly in development
   - Update documentation as needed

2. **Deploy Update**
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Render will automatically deploy from the main branch
   - Monitor deployment logs for errors

3. **Verify Update**
   - Test critical functionality after deployment
   - Monitor error rates and performance
   - Be prepared to rollback if issues occur

### Frontend Updates

1. **Build and Test**
   - Make changes in development
   - Test across different browsers and devices
   - Build production version locally first

2. **Deploy Update**
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Netlify/Render will automatically deploy from the main branch
   - Verify the deployment was successful

3. **Cache Considerations**
   - Users might see cached versions of your site
   - Consider cache-busting techniques for major updates
   - Update service worker if using PWA features

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Error Tracking

1. **Set Up Sentry**
   - Create a [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) account
   - Integrate Sentry with both frontend and backend
   - Configure alert thresholds and notifications

2. **Log Management**
   - Use Render logs for recent events
   - Consider a dedicated log management solution for long-term storage
   - Set up log rotation to manage storage

### Uptime Monitoring

1. **Set Up UptimeRobot**
   - Create a [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) account
   - Add monitors for frontend and backend endpoints
   - Configure notification channels (email, SMS, etc.)

2. **Health Checks**
   - Use the `/api/health` endpoint to verify backend status
   - Create a simple health check page for the frontend
   - Monitor response times as well as availability

## Scaling Considerations

### When to Scale

- **High CPU/Memory Usage**: If Render shows consistently high resource usage
- **Slow Response Times**: If API response times exceed 500ms consistently
- **Database Growth**: If MongoDB data size exceeds 80% of your plan's limit

### How to Scale

1. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Upgrade your Render service plan for more resources
   - Increase MongoDB Atlas tier for more storage and performance

2. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Consider splitting the backend into microservices
   - Use a load balancer for multiple backend instances
   - Implement caching with Redis for frequently accessed data

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy

1. **Database Backups**
   - Use MongoDB Atlas automated backups
   - Download manual backups periodically
   - Store backups in multiple locations

2. **Code Backups**
   - Maintain a complete Git history
   - Consider GitHub repository backups
   - Document custom configurations

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Database Recovery**
   - Restore from MongoDB Atlas backup
   - Verify data integrity after restore
   - Test the application with restored data

2. **Application Recovery**
   - Deploy from last known good commit
   - Restore environment variables and configurations
   - Verify all integrations are working

## Security Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks

1. **Dependency Scanning**
   - Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
   - Update vulnerable dependencies promptly
   - Consider using automated tools like Dependabot

2. **Access Control Review**
   - Audit admin user accounts regularly
   - Rotate API keys and secrets periodically
   - Review and update permission settings

3. **Security Headers**
   - Verify HTTP security headers are properly set
   - Use [SecurityHeaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/) to check your site
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

## Emergency Procedures

### Handling Outages

1. **Identify the Issue**
   - Check Render and MongoDB Atlas status pages
   - Review application logs for errors
   - Verify third-party service status (Stripe, etc.)

2. **Communication**
   - Inform users about the outage if appropriate
   - Provide estimated resolution time if possible
   - Update status as the situation evolves

3. **Resolution**
   - Follow specific procedures based on the issue type
   - Document the incident and resolution steps
   - Conduct a post-mortem analysis

### Security Incidents

1. **Contain the Breach**
   - Restrict access to affected systems
   - Rotate all API keys and secrets
   - Take compromised services offline if necessary

2. **Investigate**
   - Determine the scope and impact of the breach
   - Identify the entry point and vulnerability
   - Collect evidence for later analysis

3. **Remediate**
   - Patch the vulnerability
   - Restore from clean backups if necessary
   - Implement additional security measures

4. **Report**
   - Notify affected users if required
   - Report to relevant authorities if necessary
   - Document the incident and response
